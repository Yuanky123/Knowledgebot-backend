            You will be given a post and a list of comments expressing different opinions on the post.
            Your task is to:
            1. Extract the key aspects of all the comments. The "key aspects" should be concise, in a word or short phrase. It is not necessary to have a one-to-one correspondence between the key aspects and the comments. For example, two comments that are very similar in content can be summarized into one key aspect. However, you should not over-summarize the comments so that the key aspects are too few and too general.
            2. Based on the existing comments and the post, propose a new angle of discussion which is independent from all the existing arguments. The new angle of discussion should be concise, in no more than 3 words.
            3. Give a reason why this new angle is important to push the discussion forward.

            The post is:
